kantan.sbt is a collection of [SBT] plugins and settings used by all kantan.projects.

## Getting started

kantan.sbt is currently available for SBT 1.0.

The current version is `2.10.0`, which can be added to your project with the following line
in your build files (traditionally `project/plugins.sbt`, although that's not a requirement):

```scala
// Adds the core kantan.sbt plugins
addSbtPlugin("com.nrinaudo" % "kantan.sbt" % "2.10.0")

// Adds support for sbt-release
addSbtPlugin("com.nrinaudo" % "kantan.sbt-release" % "2.10.0")

// Adds support for scalafix
addSbtPlugin("com.nrinaudo" % "kantan.sbt-scalafix" % "2.10.0")

// Adds support for scalafmt
addSbtPlugin("com.nrinaudo" % "kantan.sbt-scalafmt" % "2.10.0")
```

## Motivation

The various kantan projects share a lot in the way they're built and deployed , from code standards
to release steps. The initial goal of kantan.sbt was to aggregate all these in a single plugin to
avoid maintaining the same tasks in, at the time of writing, 4 different projects.

The scope has somewhat changed since my current employer, [Besedo](https://besedo.com/), has started
using Scala - kantan.sbt has become the basis for our internal builds. Because of this, the `kantan`
submodule has been extracted and contains all the kantan-specific configuration, while the other modules
strive to be more generic.
